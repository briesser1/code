Western Electric Rules (Most Common)
Rule 1: Single Point Outside Control Limits

Any single data point falls outside the upper or lower control limits (UCL/LCL)
This is the most basic rule indicating an outlier

Rule 2: Two Out of Three Consecutive Points

Two out of three consecutive points fall in Zone A (between 2-3 sigma from centerline)
Can be on the same side or opposite sides of the centerline

Rule 3: Four Out of Five Consecutive Points

Four out of five consecutive points fall in Zone B or beyond (beyond 1 sigma from centerline)
All must be on the same side of the centerline

Rule 4: Eight Consecutive Points on Same Side

Eight or more consecutive points fall on the same side of the centerline
Indicates a sustained shift in the process

Additional Common Rules
Rule 5: Increasing or Decreasing Trend

Six or more consecutive points steadily increasing or decreasing
Indicates systematic drift in the process

Rule 6: Oscillating Pattern

Fourteen consecutive points alternating up and down
Suggests over-control or systematic cycling

Rule 7: Fifteen Points Near Centerline

Fifteen consecutive points within Zone C (within 1 sigma of centerline)
May indicate stratified sampling or reduced variation

Rule 8: Eight Points Away from Centerline

Eight consecutive points with none in Zone C
Suggests mixture of two populations or bi-modal distribution

Zone Definitions

Zone A: 2-3 sigma from centerline
Zone B: 1-2 sigma from centerline
Zone C: 0-1 sigma from centerline

These rules help distinguish between common cause variation (normal process variation) and special cause variation (assignable causes that require investigation). Most software implementations use Rules 1-4 as the standard set, with the others available as options.
