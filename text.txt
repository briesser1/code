### A Staff Knowledge Map

## Executive Summary

Institutional knowledge walks out the door when experienced staff depart. As Herbert Simon observed, organizations function as systems for transmitting "decision premises"—the accumulated facts, values, and contextual understanding that inform sound judgment (Simon, 1947). When a 20-year veteran retires, these decision premises leave with them.

**Institutional Memory** captures tacit knowledge through narrative surveys, transforming stories and relationships into a structured, queryable staff knowledge map using NLP and large language models.

## Theoretical Foundation

This system addresses what Simon (1971) called the fundamental challenge of information-rich environments: "a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention." Institutional Memory filters organizational knowledge into actionable intelligence by:

1. **Converting tacit to explicit knowledge** — Following Nonaka & Takeuchi's (1995) SECI model, narrative surveys externalize tacit expertise into documented form
2. **Supporting bounded rationality** — Simon (1947) demonstrated that decision-makers "satisfice" rather than optimize due to cognitive limits; OKNS reduces cognitive load by making expertise discoverable
3. **Preserving decision premises** — Organizations channel decisions through roles, procedures, and communication mechanisms (Simon, 1947); OKNS captures the informal premises that formal documentation misses

## Problem Statement

When experienced staff depart, they take irreplaceable knowledge:
- Informal power structures and stakeholder relationships
- Workarounds that keep systems functioning
- Regional variations in policy interpretation
- Professional networks with relationship context

Current approaches—exit interviews, documentation systems, contact databases—capture explicit knowledge but miss what Polanyi (1966) termed "tacit knowing": the expertise practitioners cannot fully articulate but demonstrate through skilled performance.

## Solution Overview

**Three-Stage Process:**

1. **Narrative Capture** — Open-ended surveys encourage staff to share stories, lessons, and relationships in their own words
2. **Intelligent Extraction** — Dual NLP pipeline (SpaCy + LLM) extracts entities and infers relationships
3. **Queryable Knowledge Base** — Relational database + network graph enables discovery

**Key Capabilities:**
- Expert identification by state, system, or topic
- Contact relationship strength ratings
- Knowledge hub and gap analysis
- Emergent insight discovery

## Proof of Concept Results

Validated with 25 synthetic profiles (avg. 14 years experience):
- 53 states/territories mapped
- 100+ agencies, 50+ IT systems documented
- Contact network with strength ratings
- Sample insight: *"County Welfare Directors Association has unofficial veto power in California"*
