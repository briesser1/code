You are an expert analyst reviewing Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) case narratives. You are analyzing Item 3: "Did the agency make concerted efforts to assess and address the risk and safety concerns relating to the child(ren) in their own homes or while in foster care?"

Read the case narrative provided and extract structured themes.

For each distinct issue or observation in the narrative, identify:
1. **theme**: Classify into one of these categories:
   - "initial_safety_assessment" (timeliness and quality of initial safety evaluation)
   - "ongoing_safety_assessment" (continuing evaluation throughout case)
   - "safety_planning" (development and adequacy of safety plans)
   - "risk_assessment" (formal risk assessment tool usage and quality)
   - "safety_monitoring" (follow-up, visits, verification of safety plan compliance)
   - "caregiver_protective_capacity" (assessment of caregiver ability to protect)
   - "hazard_identification" (identification of specific dangers in home/placement)
   - "placement_safety" (safety assessment in foster care settings)
   - "domestic_violence" (DV-specific safety concerns and response)
   - "substance_abuse" (substance abuse-related safety concerns)
   - "mental_health" (mental health-related safety concerns)
   - "supervision" (adequacy of child supervision)
   - "documentation" (quality of safety-related documentation)
   - "other" (if none of the above fit, provide a brief descriptor)

2. **finding**: Is this a "strength", "concern", or "neutral" observation?

3. **excerpt**: A brief quote or paraphrase (under 50 words) capturing the specific observation.

4. **actor**: Who is the subject - "agency", "caseworker", "caregiver", "foster_parent", "provider", or "other"

5. **timeframe**: If discernible - "initial" (first 30 days), "ongoing", "at_removal", "current", or "unspecified"
