# Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard: Common Aspects Across States

## Overview

The Reasonable and Prudent Parenting Standard (RPPS) is a federally-mandated standard established by the **Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act of 2014** (Public Law 113-183). All states receiving Title IV-E funding must implement this standard to promote "normalcy" for children in foster care.

---

## Core Definition

Across all states, RPPS is consistently defined as:

> **"The standard characterized by careful and sensible parental decisions that maintain the health, safety, and best interests of a child while at the same time encouraging the emotional and developmental growth of the child."**

The standard empowers caregivers to make day-to-day parenting decisions without requiring prior approval from the child welfare agency or court.

---

## Purpose and Goals

### Primary Goal: Normalcy
The overarching goal is to ensure children in foster care have opportunities for age-appropriate experiences similar to their non-foster peers. This includes:

- Removing bureaucratic barriers to everyday childhood activities
- Reducing the stigma of being a "foster child"
- Supporting healthy social, emotional, and cognitive development
- Preparing youth for successful transition to adulthood
- Building resilience through normal developmental experiences

### Key Objectives
1. Empower caregivers to make timely decisions
2. Eliminate unnecessary delays caused by agency approval processes
3. Promote healthy adolescent brain development through safe risk-taking
4. Support the development of independent living skills

## Who the Standard Applies To

RPPS applies to all designated caregivers, including:

- **Licensed foster parents**
- **Kinship caregivers** (relatives and fictive kin)
- **Group homes** (must have at least one designated RPPS decision-maker)
- **Residential care facilities**
- **Therapeutic foster homes**
- **Child-placing agencies**

## Activities Caregivers CAN Approve Under RPPS

Caregivers may use their reasonable and prudent judgment to approve:

### Social Activities
- Sleepovers at friends' homes
- Playdates and visiting with friends
- Dating
- Birthday parties and social gatherings
- Attending community events

### School and Educational Activities
- Field trips
- School dances

## Factors Caregivers Must Consider

When applying RPPS, caregivers should consider:

1. **Age and Maturity**: The child's chronological age and developmental level
2. **Health and Safety**: Potential risks and safety measures available
3. **Best Interests**: Based on information known about the child
4. **Developmental Appropriateness**: Whether the activity suits the child's cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities
5. **Child's Wishes**: The child's own preferences and desires
6. **Cultural and Religious Values**: Family traditions and beliefs
7. **Court Orders**: Any existing legal restrictions
8. **Child's History**: Trauma history, behavioral patterns, and special needs
9. **Training and Equipment**: Whether the child has necessary skills and safety gear
10. **Community Standards**: What the average parent in the community would decide

---

## Activities NOT Covered by RPPS

Certain decisions remain outside caregiver authority and require agency, court, or birth parent consent:

### Medical Decisions
- Psychotropic medication changes
- Major medical procedures
- Non-routine medical treatment
- Mental health treatment decisions

### Legal and Educational Decisions
- School enrollment or changes
- IEP (Individualized Education Program) decisions
- Legal representation
- Marriage consent
- Military enlistment

### Permanent Body Modifications
- Tattoos
- Piercings (in most states)
- Significant hair changes for children under 12 (varies by state)

### Travel (Requirements Vary by State)
- Out-of-state travel (typically requires approval for stays exceeding 48-72 hours)
- International travel (always requires agency approval)

### Other Restricted Areas
- Driving privileges (often requires ISP team or court approval)
- Hunting and firearms (requires written parental/court consent)
- Contact sports in some states
- Releasing confidential information
- Changing court-ordered visitation plans

---

## Caregiver Liability Protection

A consistent element across all states is **liability protection** for caregivers who properly apply RPPS:

- Caregivers are immune from civil liability when making reasonable and prudent decisions
- Protection applies when decisions maintain child health, safety, and best interests
- This immunity does not override other legal obligations or remove existing protections

---

## Training Requirements

States universally require RPPS training for caregivers:

- **Pre-placement training** for foster parents
- **Online training modules** for kinship caregivers
- **Specialized training** for congregate care staff
- **Ongoing education** on child development and trauma-informed care

---

## Role of Birth Parents

RPPS works best within a "Partnership Parenting" framework:

- Birth parents retain certain residual rights (religious affiliation, visitation)
- Caregivers should consult with birth parents when possible
- Open communication promotes co-parenting and reduces conflict
- Birth parent input is considered but not always determinative
- Documentation of parent preferences should occur at ISP meetings

---

## Youth Involvement

States emphasize the importance of engaging youth in decisions:

- Youth aged 12-14+ should participate in case planning
- Children's wishes should be considered (though not determinative)
- Youth have the right to report if denied normalcy activities
- Youth input helps build independent living skills
- Permanency hearings must confirm normalcy opportunities for older youth

---

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Identified Barriers
1. **Transportation**: Getting youth to activities
2. **Funding**: Costs of activities, equipment, and participation fees
3. **Congregate Care Settings**: Restrictive institutional policies
4. **Caregiver Hesitancy**: Lingering risk-averse culture
5. **Background Check Requirements**: Overly burdensome screening for informal supervision

### Solutions Implemented
- Babysitter background checks are NOT required for occasional short-term care
- States cannot create policies requiring formal screening for every supervising adult
- Agencies may only obtain publicly available information (sex offender registry, etc.)

## Key Guiding Questions for Caregivers

Before saying "no" to an activity, caregivers should ask:

1. Is it age-appropriate?
2. Is it developmentally appropriate?
3. Will it enhance the child's well-being?
4. Does it fall within RPPS decision-making authority?
5. Do I understand the child's developmental needs?
6. Will the activity expose the child to undue risk?
7. If this were my child, would I approve the request?
8. Would the average parent in my community make the same decision?

---

## Documentation and Accountability

States require ongoing tracking of normalcy activities:

- Case plans must address normalcy opportunities
- Permanency hearings must confirm RPPS is being applied
- Foster parent reports should include activities the child participated in
- Youth can report concerns about being denied normalcy activities

---

## Summary: The "Bottom Line"

**Kids in foster care get to be kids.**

The consistent message across all states is clear:
- Children in care deserve the same opportunities as their peers
- Foster parents have the authority to make daily parenting decisions
- Agencies cannot create unnecessary barriers to normalcy
- The law protects caregivers who make thoughtful, reasonable decisions

RPPS represents a fundamental shift from risk-averse policies to child-centered, developmental approaches that recognize normal childhood experiences are essential for healthy growth and successful transitions to adulthood.
