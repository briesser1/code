OCS operates 21 field offices with approximately 610 employees across five regions (Anchorage, Bethel, Fairbanks, Juneau, Wasilla). Only nine offices are accessible by road. The practice model emphasizes strengths-based, family-centered intervention focused on child safety, with diligent compliance with ICWA as a core priority.

## Assessment of Performance *(pp. 7–22)*

Alaska was not in substantial conformity with all seven CFSR outcome areas during its Round 3 PIP. Key findings:

### Safety *(pp. 7–11)*
- **Investigation timeliness** (Item 1) nearly met the PIP goal (72% vs. 77% target). Priority 1 reports are initiated timely; P2 and P3 reports are problematic. Staffing shortages are the primary barrier.
- **Services to prevent removal** (Item 2) met the PIP goal of 86% during one measurement period but dropped back to 79%.
- **Risk/safety assessment** (Item 3) did not meet the PIP goal (43% vs. 55%). In-home cases are the primary struggle. Repeat maltreatment for Alaska Native children rose to 18%.

### Permanency *(pp. 11–16)*
- **Placement stability** (Item 4) surpassed the PIP goal at 78% during one period, though aggregate data fluctuates.
- **Permanency goals** (Item 5) achieved the PIP goal for 8 consecutive periods but dropped to 50% in 2023.
- **Achieving permanency** (Item 6) achieved the PIP goal for 5 periods; 2023 aggregate was 44% vs. 55% goal.
- **Sibling placement, preserving connections, and relative placement** (Items 7, 9, 10) consistently score high (91–98%).
- **Visitation** (Item 8) remained stable around 73%.
- **Relationship with parents** (Item 11) dropped 10% in 2023 aggregate.

### Well-Being *(pp. 16–22)*
- **Needs and services** (Item 12) did not meet the PIP goal (32% vs. 40%). Fairbanks consistently outperforms other sites.
- **Family involvement in case planning** (Item 13) achieved the PIP goal for 9 periods but dropped to 48% in 2023.
- **Caseworker visits with children** (Item 14) approached but did not meet the PIP goal. Statewide rate was 64% in FFY 2023 vs. 95% national standard.
- **Caseworker visits with parents** (Item 15) met the PIP goal but statewide rates remain low (22% for mothers, 13% for fathers).
- **Educational needs** (Item 16) scored 90% strength in 2023.
- **Physical health** (Item 17) scored 88% strength in 2023.
- **Mental/behavioral health** (Item 18) improved to 74% in 2023.

### Systemic Factors *(pp. 22–33)*
- **Information System**: ORCA has reached end of life; replacement efforts stalled for lack of funding. Interim focus on data quality and governance.
- **Case Review System**: Most children have current case plans (82%); parent case plans are lower (61%) with the Western region struggling most (30%). Permanency hearings and TPR tracking have known data gaps.
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuing CFSR-instrument case reviews; training planned with Capacity Building Center for States on implementation science.
- **Training**: Major overhaul of initial staff training launching FY25 — shifting to field-based mentorship model with phased classroom instruction.
- **Service Array**: Gaps persist in rural areas; partnerships with DBH on 1115 Medicaid Waiver expansion and Cultural Resource Guide usage.
- **Foster/Adoptive Parent Licensing**: New licensing standards implemented July 2022. Background check processes significantly improved with 92% T-message response rate by June 2024. 1,227 licensed foster homes with 224 open vacancies statewide.

## Plan for Improvement — Four Goals *(pp. 34–42)*

### Goal 1: Develop a Stable Child Welfare Workforce *(pp. 34–37)*

- **2.A** — Establish prioritization principles with achievable target rates for four essential services: timely investigations, current case plans, monthly caseworker visits, and relative placements.
- **2.B** — Implement Strengthening I&A model statewide with fidelity monitoring and rural adaptations.
- **2.C** — Improve family services through better case plans, early engagement, and culturally appropriate services.
- **2.D** — Increase frequency and quality of caseworker visits with children, including alternative contact methods for access barriers.

### Goal 3: Enhancing Kinship Care *(pp. 39–42)*

- **3.B** — Develop a family meeting continuum by finalizing and expanding Team Decision Making (TDM) statewide by fall 2028.

## Services Continuum *(pp. 42–51)*

The document describes the full service continuum: prevention (Strengthening Families, Parents as Teachers, Plans of Safe Care, Tribal Compact prevention funding), intake (24/7 centralized), investigation and assessment, family services (in-home and out-of-home), and resource families (licensing, recruitment, ICPC). The service array section covers Title IV-B funded programs including Child Advocacy Centers, Circles of Support family preservation, family contact/visitation services, adoption support through ACRF, independent living, mentorship through Big Brothers Big Sisters, emergency shelter through Covenant House, and Youth Interim Services. *(pp. 42–47)*

---

## Chafee/Independent Living *(pp. 53–57)*

OCS serves youth aged 16–21 (ETV up to 23) through seven Regional Independent Living Specialists. Services include life skills training, Casey Life Skills Assessments, NYTD data collection, ETV administration through the University of Alaska's Child Welfare Academy, mentorship through FFCA, and housing support. The Governor allocated $1M for youth 18–23 transition support, and the Mental Health Trust Authority provides $250K for housing/transportation for youth 21+.

---

## Tribal Consultation and Collaboration *(pp. 57–60)*

The Alaska Tribal Child Welfare Compact (signed 2017) involves 20 Tribal co-signers representing 172 individual Tribes. Collaborative forums include the Tribal State Collaboration Group, Tribal State Advisory Team, Tribal-State Data Group, and Regional Tribal State Committees. Services provided through the Compact include relative searches, prevention, and licensing assistance. OCS continues expanding Title IV-E pass-through agreements with Tribal partners.

---

## Targeted Plans *(pp. 60–63)*

- **Diligent Recruitment**: General and targeted recruitment strategies including Yupik-language radio ads, cultural event outreach, LGBTQI-specific efforts, and the Heart Gallery/Adoption Learning Path through ACRF.
- **Health Care Oversight**: Medical Director from Health Care Services serves as Health Authority; central Medical Mental Health Unit for complex cases; biennial HOCP committee meetings.
- **Disaster Plan**: OCS Safety and Security unit created; improved COOP plan; advanced FEMA certifications for staff.
- **Training Plan**: New FY25 curriculum with 4-week phased training (virtual + field), 6-month mentorship, and subsequent CWA subject matter sessions.

---

## Financial Information *(pp. 63–64)*

Title IV-B subpart 2 spending in FFY 2022 was disproportionate across the four PSSF categories, with 50% going to time-limited family reunification and 0% to adoption promotion (funded separately through state general funds). Chafee spending on room/board was 14% of the allotment, within the 30% cap. The state did not use IV-B funds for administrative costs.

## Key Themes Across the Document

1. **Workforce crisis** — 46% turnover is the central challenge affecting every outcome area.
2. **Alaska Native disproportionality** — AN/AI children are vastly overrepresented; the Tribal Compact and ICWA compliance are primary strategies.
3. **Geographic barriers** — Only 9 of 21 offices are road-accessible; rural service delivery is a persistent challenge.
4. **Aging data infrastructure** — ORCA replacement is stalled; interim focus on data quality.
5. **Permanency delays** — Reunification, adoption, and guardianship timelines consistently fall short of federal expectations.
6. **Training transformation** — Major shift from classroom-based to field-based mentored training for new staff.
